This personal learning assignment was inspired by the work at Northwood Space co.

Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of a learning exercise to understand TCP/IP communication and network simulation. Portions of the code and conceptual guidance were inspired by assistance from ChatGPT, an AI model by OpenAI.

Learning Goal of This Mini Project:
This mini project is designed to simulate and visualize TCP/IP communication within a network. The primary learning objectives are:

Understand the basics of TCP/IP communication:

Learn how data is transmitted between devices using the TCP handshake (SYN, ACK, FIN).
Explore the concept of packets and how they travel across a network.
Develop practical skills in network simulation:

Use Python's socket library to simulate client-server communication.
Visualize network topology and packet flow using networkx and matplotlib.
Gain insights into network routing and packet flow:

Highlight paths taken by packets in a dynamic network.
Simulate and understand real-world network behaviors like routing, delays, and communication paths.
Apply programming and visualization techniques:

Strengthen Python programming skills.
Create visual representations of theoretical networking concepts.
This project provides a foundation for further exploration into distributed systems, networking protocols, and system reliability.
